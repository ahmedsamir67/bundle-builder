# Keeps the Cursor and Claude Code copies of our AI configuration identical.
#
# Why this exists: on the Bites Vitamins build the conventions lived only in
# .cursor/rules/. Claude Code does not read that path, so for the first 18 days
# of the build the agent had no access to them and ~30 sections shipped without
# the section schema contract or translation keys. Two hand-maintained copies is
# how that happened; this script makes drift impossible instead of discouraged.
#
# Canonical source is .claude/ — edit there, never in .cursor/.
#   Rules:     .claude/rules/*.md        -> .cursor/rules/*.mdc  (frontmatter converted)
#   Examples:  .claude/rules/examples/** -> .cursor/rules/examples/**  (verbatim)
#   Skills:    .claude/skills/**         -> .cursor/skills/**          (verbatim)
#   Agents:    .claude/agents/**         -> .cursor/agents/**          (verbatim)
#   Workflows: .claude/workflows/**      -> .cursor/workflows/**       (verbatim)
#   References:.claude/references/**     -> .cursor/references/**      (verbatim)
#
# Examples, agents and workflows were added after an audit found that a rule
# could link an example file the fork had never received (the examples lived
# under .cursor/, which .claude/ forks do not carry), and that Cursor users had
# no copy of the two review agents at all. Cursor does not auto-load agents or
# workflows the way it loads rules — the point is that a human can open them.
#
# Generated .mdc files carry a checksum of their own content. Before overwriting
# one, the script recomputes it: if it no longer matches, the file was edited by
# hand and the script REFUSES rather than silently discarding that work. Without
# this, the hook told a Cursor user their .cursor copy had diverged and the fix
# command then destroyed the change they had just made.
#
# Note the weaker guarantee for skills: they are byte-identical copies with no
# banner to carry a checksum, so a hand-edit there cannot be distinguished from
# a source change and will be overwritten. Never edit .cursor/skills/ directly.
#
# Usage: sh .claude/scripts/sync-ai-config.sh [--check] [--force]
#   --check  exit 1 if anything is out of sync, write nothing (for the hook)
#   --force  overwrite even a hand-edited .mdc (discards it — last resort)
