# Architecture Standards

## Section Naming and Structure

### Section File Naming
- **DO NOT** use `main-` prefix for new sections
- The `main-` prefix is reserved for main template sections in the `@templates` folder
- Name sections based on their functionality:
  - `featured-collections.liquid`
  - `featured-products.liquid`
  - `image-banner.liquid`
  - `hero-banner.liquid`
  - `testimonials.liquid`

### Section Structure Example
```liquid
<product-info
  data-url="{{ product.url}}"
  data-section="{{ section.id }}"
  class="color-{{ section.settings.color_scheme }} section-{{ section.id }}-padding"
>
  <!-- Section content here -->
</product-info>
```

### Section JavaScript
JavaScript for sections is optional. Inline scripts inside a section are allowed for small amounts of logic. As a guideline, keep inline scripts to roughly 100 lines or fewer. If the script exceeds ~100 lines or becomes complex, move it into `assets/section-[section-name].js`. When adding JavaScript to sections, use custom elements:

**File naming:** `section-[section-name].js`
- `section-featured-collections.js`
- `section-featured-products.js`
- `section-image-banner.js`

**Custom Element Structure:**
```javascript
if (!customElements.get('custom-element')) {
  customElements.define(
    'custom-element',
    class CustomElement extends HTMLElement {
      constructor() {
        super();
      }

      connectedCallback() {
        // Initialize component when added to DOM
      }

      disconnectedCallback() {
        // Cleanup when removed from DOM
      }
    }
  );
}
```

### Section CSS
**File naming:** `section-[section-name].css`
- `section-featured-collections.css`
- `section-featured-products.css`
- `section-image-banner.css`

## Snippet Naming and Structure

### Snippet File Naming
- **99% of the time** snippets are prefixed with `component-`
- Name based on functionality:
  - `component-product-card.liquid`
  - `component-cart-drawer.liquid`
  - `component-filters-sidebar.liquid`

### Snippet JavaScript
When adding JavaScript to snippets, use custom elements:

**File naming:** `component-[component-name].js`
- `component-product-card.js`
- `component-cart-drawer.js`
- `component-filters-sidebar.js`

**Custom Element Structure:** (Same as sections)
```javascript
if (!customElements.get('product-card')) {
  customElements.define(
    'product-card',
    class ProductCard extends HTMLElement {
      constructor() {
        super();
      }

      connectedCallback() {
        // Initialize component
      }

      disconnectedCallback() {
        // Cleanup
      }
    }
  );
}
```

### Snippet CSS
**File naming:** `component-[component-name].css`
- `component-product-card.css`
- `component-cart-drawer.css`
- `component-filters-sidebar.css`

## Examples

### Section Example: Featured Products
**Files:**
- `sections/featured-products.liquid`
- `assets/section-featured-products.js`
- `assets/section-featured-products.css`

### Component Example: Product Card
**Files:**
- `snippets/component-product-card.liquid`
- `assets/component-product-card.js`
- `assets/component-product-card.css`

## Shared vs. Section-Owned — the decision test

The recurring question: something works on several pages — does it become one
shared `component-*` file, or a `section-*` file per page?

**Apply this test.**

> Is the behaviour and appearance genuinely the *same* thing in every place it
> is used, differing only in content and configuration values?
>
> - **Yes** → one shared `component-*` file, built so consumers configure it.
> - **No** → separate `section-*` files, one per section.

Both answers already exist in this codebase and both are correct in context:

| Case | Answer | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Base's three product carousels — Featured Products, Related Products, Featured Collections v2 | **Separate** `section-*` files | Each wraps Swiper with genuinely different configuration, breakpoints and slide structure. They are three different carousels that happen to share a library. |
| A scroll-snap-plus-dots carousel used by several content sections | **One shared** `component-*` | Identical behaviour and markup contract; only the cards inside and the values differ. |

The second case is what the compliance checklist means by "a genuine atomic UI
primitive" — the exception it already carves out of its general preference for
duplication. The test above is how to tell whether you are in it, rather than
having to judge the phrase.

### Building a shared primitive so it stays shared

If the test says shared, build it to absorb the *next* design rather than
hardcoding the first one:

- Behaviour toggles via data attributes on the element — dots on/off, snap
  alignment, items per view, loop. Not branching on a page name or a class.
- Appearance via CSS custom properties the consuming section sets, so a new
  design is new values rather than a new file.
- No consumer-specific names anywhere inside — no `if (page === 'about')`.

If a new design cannot be expressed in configuration and needs the primitive's
internals edited, that is the test telling you it was a "No" — split it.

### Naming follows actual scope, not origin

A `section-*` file must not be loaded by more than one unrelated section. If
something turns out to be genuinely shared, it is renamed to `component-*` —
it does not keep the name of whichever page happened to need it first.

This is the concrete failure it prevents: on Bites Vitamins,
a `section-about-carousel.js` ended up loaded by eight sections across four
pages, keeping a name that implied single-page scope. Generalising the code was
right; not renaming it was the mistake. **When you widen a file's scope, rename
it in the same change.**

## Key Rules Summary
1. **Sections:** No `main-` prefix for new sections; name by function, not by page
1a. **Scope:** Apply the decision test above before sharing or duplicating; rename when scope widens
2. **JavaScript:** Use custom elements when JS is needed (JS files are optional)
3. **Naming:** Consistent prefixes (`section-` or `component-`)
4. **File Types:** When present, match naming across `.liquid`, `.js`, and `.css` files (JS/CSS optional)
